Hello everyone, now I show you is based on the C865 development kit image enhancement 1.0 version. Can be used to increase the camera image resolution enhancement scenarios, such as we are in need of to monitoring, but monitoring equipment on the number of shooting phase is lower, can we need to deal with clarity, version 1.0 is the number of phase static image enhancement, low resolution version 2.0, we will implement in the late of video frame, enhance video clarity. Let's introduce my demo scenario. Firstly, the IP Camera and C865 are connected in the same LAN and the IP Camera will take a static picture every 2 seconds. The C865 connects to the display through HDMI, and the C865 obtains video stream from the IP Camera through RTSP protocol to display the original image and the image with enhanced resolution.
To start the demo, open the application and click Settings to add the RTSP video stream. Now we can see that we can constantly change scenes and get the original and enhanced images for different scenes. All right, that's it for the demo.
